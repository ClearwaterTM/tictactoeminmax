# tictactoeminmax
A solo project that I developed during the second year of my comsci studies.

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java, which contains various methods of play possible by the player and CPU, using various CPU algorithms such as minmax and Negamax to determine the next move to play.
